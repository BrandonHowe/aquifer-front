# disclone

This is the front end of my disclone. It's a clone of discord that I'm making to reinforce my knowledge of Vue, Webpack, and websockets. Hopefully it'll grow into something meaningful but it probably won't. Do what you wish with this repo, although I am not going to accept PR's (most likely).

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
webpack
```
I use webpack to serve my files, you can use npm run serve but I prefer webpack. Output goes to dist/disclone.html.

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
Again, I use webpack, so this is kind of unnecessary.

### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
